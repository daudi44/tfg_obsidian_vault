#Planning

The objective of my project is develop a completely new product using existing frameworks and libraries for saving time on minor tasks, like handling and formatting dates. 

The methodology that I choose for the development of the project is, the iterative development. Establishing a goal and after two weeks or the time set for completing the goal, revise the results and conclude if I can go to the next goal or if I have to make another iteration improving the previous one until I reach the desired state.

The advantage of using this methodology is that the project will grow up after each iteration, providing new features regularly and allowing me to keep updating the project until I get satisfied with the result without being overwhelmed by all the tasks that must be carried out in total.
Moreover, the fast feedback of each implementation will provide me a guide of the next steps that must be taken.
