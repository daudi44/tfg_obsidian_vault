During the development process of the project, I want to achieve multiple goals:

- Backend
	- Provide a consistent and reliable API REST for my application.
		- Develop appropriate tests.
		- Establish models and interactions between them using relationships.
	- Preserve user data integrity.
- Frontend 
	- Design a usable and pretty interface.
	- Make the user interactions with the application smoother as possible.
	- Publish the project for any user successfully.
