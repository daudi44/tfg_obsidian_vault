#Planning

During these years thanks to the efforts of people, we've established some development goals for the care of the world and the society around us. That's why in this section I'm going to study how my project output will interact with all of these established goals.
## **Sustainability**
SDG. 7 - 9 - 11 - 12 - 13 - 14 - 15

My project does not affect in most of sustainability goals directly, but I think there are some points we have to take into account about its positiveness or negativeness with the sustainability and ecological footprint. 

First let's see the negative outcome. As my project will be a Web Application divided into a frontend, a backend and a database, all of this services will be hosted in a server. This server will use X resources depending on, the amount of users using the application and the stored data. At first, as it's a personal project and just a few people will test it, the resources consumption will be low, but if this project somewhere in the time scales up to thousands of users, the overall consumption would be high, increasing the energy and contamination coming from the project.

As a positive outcome of my project, showing to the user all the expenses that he makes can induce more consciousness about their ecological footprint, reducing their spending of money and products, which translates into more responsible consumption.

Sustainability it's not a motivation for this project but it's important to keep in mind how the project outcome would affect to it.
## **Ethical behaviour and social responsibility**
SDG. 1 - 2 - 6 - 8 - 16

The outcome of the project does not have any negative impact on the ethical or social aspects. On the contrary, the usage of this project will impulse users to be more productive on their jobs or in the projects where they are involved, registering all the hours spent doing unproductive activities (scrolling on social media, watching series, and many others), in order to have a control about how they lose their time, and being able to redirect that time to important things. 
Moreover, for the youth of today's world who are being bombarded with so many useless products, subscriptions or services, which make them spend, reducing their ability to save money, this app will be helpful for them to achieve better results in long term.

This social compromise of allowing the people to focus on how they spend their time and money it's the reason that impulsed my motivation of doing this project.
## **Diversity, gender and human rights**
SDG. 5 - 10

In this section my project does not have any impact, positive or negative, the application can be used by any person no matters it's gender, race, religion, ethnic, sexual orientation, functional, ideology or another characteristic without impacting on the human rights.

By the moment the application would be fully developed in English, but if it starts to grow up one of the objectives is to translate it to any language. The information of the users will be stored on a private database encrypting the personal data and preventing from fraudulent usage for other benefits.

This section it's not one motivation of my project, because I think everyone should be able to use any application without differentiating between groups of people, we are all equal.
