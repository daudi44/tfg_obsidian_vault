#Planning

During some months since I've started to work and think in how to manage my incomes I have considered creating an excel where have a register for each month incomes and expenses.
At the same time I was using 2 web applications ([Trello](https://trello.com/) and [Monday](https://monday.com/lang/esMonday)) for managing my UOC deliveries and the development of personal projects. 

Moreover, last months I've started to care about how I use my time each day, and where I'm wasting time or where I should pay more attention. Then I found dotetimer, a mobile app, that allows you to record the time spent in your tasks. 
But in my case I was searching for something that records everything of my day, in order to have statistics about my routine.

After analyzing my situation, I noticed about the inefficiency of the workflow, and how having a single web application would help me to handle all these key points of my day. 
If this application at the same time allows me to keep track of the time spent sleeping, using social medias, watching series, working and doing tasks, I would be able to improve my efficiency and focus on important things based on tangible data.

Peak Space proposes a centralized system for managing your economy, tasks, projects and **time**. 
Everyone that wants to become a productive and organised person will consider using it.

Here I list the main benefits and the value that offers to the final user:

- Improved control of the economy
- Awareness of the money usage
- Awareness of the time usage daily
- Improved project managing and consistence
- More success with your tasks and objectives

Summarizing, the result will be a solid, easy to use and powerful web application that will impulse the economy management and productivity of its users.
